# NeuronMosaicsDetection
This project is a part of my Master Studies' Scientific Computation course. The code is written using Python. This project is done in collaboration with Marinela Parovic and Milos Samardzija. 
The main idea of this project is to apply various types of algorithms to the data (10 mosaics) and try to come to some interesting conclusions.
